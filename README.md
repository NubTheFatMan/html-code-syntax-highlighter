# Browser Syntax Highlighter
This is a clientside syntax highler for HTML. Client needs JS enabled to work.
This is currently set up for gmod lua syntax highlighting but by changing the keywords Object and the regex in `luaTokenizer()`, it can support most languages if you know how that language works.
